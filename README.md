# Why the Pareto Distribution in Supply Chain

The Pareto principle (80/20) states that 80% of the outputs come from 20% of the inputs. This rule has  real life business value.

In terms of supply chain, it tells us that 80% of the instances (shipment/profit/orders) in a supply chain are driven by 20% of the references (ship-to/SKU/customers). It is not an exact prediction of 80% -20% but rather highlighting the fact that a small proportion drives the whole.

This has practical real life business value since a company has finite resources whether that be Time or Money.

This code was created to show how even cosmetic orders for large luxury brands follows this pattern. From the picture generated it makes sense when solving problems along the supply chain focus is put on the 20%.

## Objective
This code was built to visualize the pareto principle on cosmetic orders.

## Code
This repository code would be a first step of analysis rendered using Python Flask. You too can use it by:
1. Copy Github repository in your local folder and create a local python environment
2. Download libraries listed in requirements.txt
```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch app.py
```
py app.py
```

## Next Steps
